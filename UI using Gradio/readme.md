# Image Question Answering with BLIP

This repository demonstrates how to create an interactive web interface for an image question-answering model using Gradio. The BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining) model is used to generate answers to questions based on an uploaded image.

## Introduction

Gradio is a Python library that allows you to quickly create user interfaces for machine learning models. The `gr.Interface` class is designed to create demos for models that accept one or more inputs and return one or more outputs.

## Key Components of the Interface Class

The `Interface` class has three core arguments:
- `fn`: The function to wrap a user interface (UI) around.
- `inputs`: The Gradio component(s) to use for the input. The number of components should match the number of arguments in your function.
- `outputs`: The Gradio component(s) to use for the output. The number of components should match the number of return values from your function.

The `fn` argument is flexible â€” you can pass any Python function you want to wrap with a UI. This function could be anything from a music generator to a tax calculator to the prediction function of a pretrained machine learning model.

The `inputs` and `outputs` arguments take one or more Gradio components. Gradio includes more than 30 built-in components (such as `gr.Textbox()`, `gr.Image()`, and `gr.HTML()`) that are designed for machine learning applications.
